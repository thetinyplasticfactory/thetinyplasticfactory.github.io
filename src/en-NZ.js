      TheTiny:
        "The Tiny Plastic Factory recycles used plastic from local businesses and supplies quality recycled plastic feedstock to manufacturers. Our purpose is to accelerate the transition of the global plastics industry towards a circular economy.",
      CurrentlyGlobal:
        "Currently global plastic recycling rates average below 10%, with the majority of all plastic produced only ever being used once. Businesses have few ways, if any, of responsibly disposing of their used plastic, and manufacturers have limited options for buying quality recycled plastic. We're here to change this.",
      UsingSmall:
        "Using small scale infrastructure and by operating locally, we ensure 100% of the plastic we process is recycled without compromise. With a fully integrated supply chain, we're able to implement a high standard of quality control within our recycling processes and the recycled plastic feedstock we produce.",
